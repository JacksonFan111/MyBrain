                    <p>Below is a summarized overview of the discussions and logic clarifications around the 16.12.2024 FATCA/CRS bug fix, suitable for a Confluence knowledge base entry.</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> 16 December 2024<br/><strong>Topic:</strong> FATCA/CRS Reporting Bug Fix &amp; Data Quality Issues</p><p><strong>Key Issues Identified:</strong></p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Individual Accounts with Multiple Persons/Controlling Roles</strong></p><ul><li><p>Certain individual accounts are found to have multiple associated individuals (e.g., authorized persons, controlling persons) who may be US or CRS reportable, even when the account holder is not a US person.</p></li><li><p>Example:<br/><em>Mrs. Zeta Eleanor Robertson</em> (Individual) has multiple controlling persons, including one with US indicia. This scenario complicates FATCA reporting as it appears to be an “Individual” account but behaves more like a structure with multiple controlling individuals.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Data Quality vs. System Logic</strong></p><ul><li><p>Discrepancies arise due to data classification issues in CRM (e.g., accounts originally joint but converted to individual after one party’s death, yet roles and tax indicators remain inconsistent).</p></li><li><p>Example:<br/><em>Frances Anne Stone (602680)</em> was previously in a joint account that became an individual account after the co-owner’s death. However, an authorized person with US/UK tax indicia remains on the account, causing confusion in the reporting logic.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>FATCA/CRS Reporting Logic Challenges</strong></p><ul><li><p>For an individual account, standard logic assumes a single account holder with no controlling persons. Yet, exceptions are found where authorized or controlling persons have foreign tax indicia.</p></li><li><p>If a US (or CRS-reportable) person has control or authority over the account, this triggers reporting obligations, even if the primary account holder is not US/CRS-reportable.</p></li><li><p>The system must handle cases where:</p><ul><li><p>Non-US individual accounts have US controlling persons (FATCA).</p></li><li><p>Non-CRS individual accounts have CRS-reportable controlling persons (CRS).</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>FATCA Reporting Specifics</strong></p><ul><li><p>If the primary individual account holder is not a US person and has no US TIN, use the code &quot;999999999&quot; as per guidance.</p></li><li><p>The presence of a US controlling person requires reporting the account under FATCA category:<br/><strong>1 - Owner-Documented FFI with Substantial U.S. Owners / Controlling Persons (FATCA101)</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Even though the account is “individual,” if there is a substantial US controlling person, that person must appear on the FATCA report.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>CRS Reporting Specifics</strong></p><ul><li><p>Similar logic applies to CRS. If an authorized person or controlling person has CRS indicia (e.g., UK resident with a NIN), the account becomes CRS-reportable.</p></li><li><p>Poor data quality (incorrect entity types, roles, or missing foreign tax flags) can cause under- or over-reporting.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Resolutions and Recommendations:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Data Quality Improvements:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ensure CRM data is accurate and consistent:</p><ul><li><p>Correctly classify the entity type (Individual vs. Joint vs. Trust).</p></li><li><p>Update roles (e.g., remove “Other” role if now “Authorised Person”).</p></li><li><p>Maintain correct ownership percentages and foreign tax flags.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Data corrections must be completed before the reporting deadlines to avoid incorrect FATCA/CRS submissions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>System Logic Adjustments:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Update logic to handle scenarios where individual accounts have controlling persons with reportable tax indicia.</p></li><li><p>When encountering unusual data scenarios (e.g., multiple controlling persons for an individual account), treat them as reportable if any controlling person meets US/CRS criteria.</p></li><li><p>Avoid creating exceptions or “hard-coding” around poor data. Instead, ensure the data is rectified so that the logic can remain straightforward and rule-based.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Validation and Exception Reporting:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Implement exception reports to flag questionable data (e.g., individual accounts with multiple controllers, missing TINs, or incorrect entity classifications).</p></li><li><p>Provide these reports to data stewards to correct records before final FATCA/CRS runs.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Individual accounts can still trigger FATCA/CRS reporting if non-account-holder individuals (controlling, authorized) have US or CRS indicia.</p></li><li><p>The code should not attempt to solve data quality issues. Instead, CRM data must be corrected to reflect true account structures and tax statuses.</p></li><li><p>Accurate, black-and-white logic is only possible when underlying data is consistent and correct.</p></li><li><p>The “999999999” code should be used for FATCA TIN fields for non-US account holders without a US TIN.</p></li></ul><hr/><p>This summary highlights the importance of data integrity and the need for clear, consistent rules to ensure correct and compliant FATCA/CRS reporting.</p>
