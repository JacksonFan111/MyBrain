                    <p>Below is a detailed explanation of the situation based on the provided context, addressing the <strong>What, Why, When, Who, and How</strong> of the gap, followed by a step-by-step resolution and communication guide for the CIP Data Team.</p><hr/><h3 id="temp2-ExplanationoftheGap">Explanation of the Gap</h3><h4 id="temp2-What">What</h4><p>The gap revolves around an incomplete script provided by the NZXWT team, which was intended to extract data to resolve multiple discrepancies between the CIP and MT environments (e.g., mismatched QuayStreet asset names, tax rates, country-city data, etc.). On March 5, 2025, it was assumed that running this script would be straightforward, but its incompleteness halted progress, expanding the scope of work for the CIP Data Team. Instead of simply executing a provided solution, the team is now expected to troubleshoot and potentially rewrite the script for each issue.</p><h4 id="temp2-Why">Why</h4><p>The issue arose because:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Incomplete Delivery</strong>: The NZXWT team delivered an incomplete script, lacking critical components needed for execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misaligned Expectations</strong>: Cathy (presumably a stakeholder or project lead) assumed the CIP Data Team would take on the responsibility of completing and troubleshooting the script, rather than relying on NZXWT to provide a fully functional solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scope Creep</strong>: This misunderstanding shifted the burden from NZXWT (who likely have deeper context on the script) to the CIP Data Team, increasing their workload and delaying resolution.</p></li></ol><h4 id="temp2-When">When</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Initial Assumption</strong>: On March 5, 2025 (a day after the current date of March 4, 2025), it was assumed the script could be run easily.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discovery of Issue</strong>: Shortly after, on or around March 5, 2025, the incomplete nature of the script was identified, stalling progress.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current State</strong>: As of now (assuming communication is happening close to March 5), JF has recognized the expanded scope and is seeking to realign responsibilities.</p></li></ul><h4 id="temp2-Who">Who</h4><ul><li><p><strong>NZXWT Team</strong>: Responsible for originally providing the incomplete script and expected to deliver a complete version.</p></li><li><p><strong>CIP Data Team</strong>: Tasked with running queries and providing data (e.g., lists of impacted clients) but now facing an expanded role due to the incomplete script.</p></li><li><p><strong>JF</strong>: Likely a team lead or coordinator (possibly from the CIP side) who identified the issue and is driving resolution by involving Cathy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cathy</strong>: A key stakeholder or liaison (possibly from Craigs or a coordinating entity) who expected the CIP Data Team to troubleshoot the script and is now being asked to re-engage NZXWT.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jude’s Team</strong>: Responsible for manually fixing issues once data is provided by the CIP Data Team.</p></li></ul><h4 id="temp2-How">How</h4><p>The gap emerged through a breakdown in communication and delivery:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>NZXWT provided an incomplete script, possibly due to oversight or unclear requirements.</p></li><li><p>Cathy assumed the CIP Data Team could fill the gap, leading to an uncommunicated expansion of their role.</p></li><li><p>JF recognized the inefficiency and impracticality of this approach, prompting a request for Cathy to push back on NZXWT for a complete solution.</p></li></ol><hr/><h3 id="temp2-Step-by-StepResolutionandCommunicationGuidefortheCIPDataTeam">Step-by-Step Resolution and Communication Guide for the CIP Data Team</h3><h4 id="temp2-Objective">Objective</h4><p>To resolve the script-related gap efficiently by ensuring NZXWT provides a complete, executable script, minimizing scope creep for the CIP Data Team, and enabling Jude’s team to proceed with manual fixes.</p><h4 id="temp2-Step-by-StepResolution">Step-by-Step Resolution</h4><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Assess the Current Script</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: The CIP Data Team should briefly review the incomplete script provided by NZXWT to identify specific missing elements (e.g., missing SQL clauses, undefined variables, or incomplete logic).</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This provides concrete examples to share with NZXWT, making the request for a complete script more actionable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: CIP Data Team (minimal effort, ~1-2 hours).</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: A short list of identified gaps (e.g., “The script for I01 lacks the JOIN clause to link Asset and Client tables”).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Draft a Clear Request to Cathy</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: JF (or a CIP Data Team representative) drafts an email to Cathy, outlining the issue and requesting her to escalate to NZXWT for a complete script.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To formalize the handoff and ensure accountability shifts back to NZXWT.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: JF or CIP Data Team lead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: A concise email (see communication guide below).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Cathy Engages NZXWT</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Cathy contacts the NZXWT team, relaying the CIP Data Team’s findings and requesting a fully functional script for all listed issues (I01-I09).</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To leverage Cathy’s authority and relationship with NZXWT to expedite delivery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: Cathy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: NZXWT commits to providing the complete script by a specified deadline.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Receive and Validate the Script</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Once NZXWT provides the updated script, the CIP Data Team runs it in a test environment to confirm it works as expected (e.g., extracts data for I01, I03, I06, I08, I09 as per the document).</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To ensure the solution meets requirements before proceeding with client data extraction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: CIP Data Team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: Confirmation of script functionality or a list of remaining issues (if any).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Extract and Share Data</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Run the validated script to generate lists of impacted clients for issues requiring manual fixes (e.g., I01, I03, I06, I08, I09) and share with Jude’s team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To fulfill the CIP Data Team’s original role and enable Jude’s team to proceed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: CIP Data Team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: Data files or reports sent to Jude’s team.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Monitor and Document</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Document the process (e.g., script issues, communication steps, resolution) and monitor Jude’s team progress to ensure no further blockers arise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To maintain a record for future reference and ensure smooth handoff.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: CIP Data Team (with JF oversight).</p></li><li><p><strong>Output</strong>: A brief internal report or log entry.</p></li></ul></li></ol><hr/><h4 id="temp2-CommunicationGuideforCIPDataTeam">Communication Guide for CIP Data

Needed</p><p>Hi Cathy,</p><p>I hope you’re well. Following our efforts to execute the script provided by NZXWT on March 5, 2025, we’ve encountered an issue: the script is incomplete and cannot be run as-is to extract the necessary data for issues like I01 (QuayStreet Asset Names), I03 (CountryCity), and others. For example, [insert specific gap, e.g., “the I01 query lacks a JOIN to the Client table”].</p><p>Initially, we assumed this would be a straightforward task, but troubleshooting and completing the script ourselves significantly expands our scope beyond running queries and providing data for Jude’s team to fix manually. To keep this on track efficiently, could you please approach the NZXWT team and request a fully functional script covering all issues (I01-I09)? This would allow us to stick to our role of data extraction and avoid delays.</p><p>Happy to provide more details on the script gaps if needed.
