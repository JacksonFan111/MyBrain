</div></div><p /><p>A modern Power BI expert reviewing this code might learn several key lessons and observations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dynamic Parameterization of DAX Measures:</strong><br/>The code demonstrates how to inject user-defined parameters (like reporting date and year) into DAX measure definitions dynamically. This shows an approach to parameterize calculations that otherwise might be hardcoded in the Tabular Model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic SQL to Build DAX Queries:</strong><br/>By concatenating parts of the DAX query into a dynamic SQL string, the script shows how you can generate a complete DAX script on the fly. Although this technique works, an expert might consider alternative methods (like using built-in parameters or query functions in modern Power BI) to improve maintainability and security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bridging SQL Server and Analysis Services:</strong><br/>The script uses OPENQUERY against a Tabular Model (Analysis Services) from SQL Server. A Power BI expert would appreciate how this approach offloads heavy calculations to the Analysis Services engine and can be useful in scenarios where you want to centralize complex business logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Staging and Data Transformation Without Permanent Changes:</strong><br/>Instead of updating permanent tables, the script leverages temporary tables for every transformation step. This is a useful pattern for testing and prototyping without affecting production data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling Complex Business Logic:</strong><br/>The code includes a variety of DAX measures that filter, aggregate, and calculate different metrics (e.g., term deposit income, accrued interest, cash management transactions, etc.). An expert would see this as a demonstration of how complex business logic can be decomposed into individual measures and then reassembled in a final aggregated output.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legacy vs. Modern Approaches:</strong><br/>While dynamic SQL and temporary table staging were common in older ETL processes, modern Power BI often uses Power Query (M language) for transformations and parameters directly within the model. An expert would weigh the pros and cons of this method versus a more modern, integrated approach.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, the code teaches how to:</p><ul><li><p>Dynamically generate DAX measure definitions using SQL.</p></li><li><p>Use parameters to customize DAX calculations on the fly.</p></li><li><p>Integrate SQL Server with a Tabular Model via OPENQUERY.</p></li><li><p>Use temporary tables to stage and transform data without impacting permanent structures.</p></li></ul><p>These techniques can be powerful, but a modern Power BI expert would also consider more contemporary alternatives for ease of maintenance and security.</p><hr/><p>Below is a detailed evaluation of how a Power BI engine would process each DAX measure in the script—keeping in mind that the 'Account Holdings Monthly' table contains only month‑end snapshot data. This means that all calculations using that table will reflect values as of the last day of the month. I've grouped the measures by their purpose and added commentary on both the filter context and any implications from using month‑end data.</p><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-1.TermDepositMeasures(Using&#39;AccountHoldingsMonthly&#39;)">1.

If you need intra‑month detail, additional tables or data sources would be required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time Intelligence Considerations:</strong><br/>When using these measures in Power BI, you must be aware that trends over time will only show month‑end values. Slicers or visuals comparing daily data might not work as expected if the underlying data is only monthly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aggregation Context:</strong><br/>The engine will evaluate these measures based solely on the snapshot. For example, TotalTDIncAI will always pull the value as of the month‑end and will not change during the month.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modified Approach:</strong><br/>If intra‑month trends or more granular analysis is needed, consider integrating a daily snapshot table or adjusting the data refresh so that more frequent snapshots are captured. Otherwise, the model as-is is ideal for month‑end financial reporting.</p></li></ul><hr/><p>This evaluation shows that the Power BI engine will follow the filter context defined in each measure, summing values from the appropriate columns and applying the conditions specified. The use of dynamic parameters (like @ReportingDate and @Year) ensures that all calculations are aligned with the chosen month‑end snapshot, which is critical for consistent financial reporting.</p><p /><hr/><p>Below is an explanation of the financial meaning behind these measures—what they represent in our model and why they’re important:</p><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-1.TermDepositMeasures">1. Term Deposit Measures</h3><ul><li><p><strong>TotalTDIncAI</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This measure calculates the total income (the overall value) of term deposits at month‑end in NZD.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>It tells you the full amount held in term deposits as of the snapshot date—an important figure for assessing overall investment size.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalTDAI</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This measure sums up the accrued interest on term deposits. “Accrued” means the interest has been earned over time, even if it hasn’t yet been paid out.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>Accrued interest reflects earnings that have built up. It shows how much additional value has been earned on top of the deposited principal, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalTDIncAILocal &amp; TotalTDAILocal</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong><br/>These are the same as the previous two measures but expressed in the local currency instead of NZD.<br/><strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>They allow comparison or consolidation when the bank operates in multiple currencies, ensuring all values are accurately captured in the appropriate currency context.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalTDFaceValueLocal &amp; TotalTDFaceValue</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong><br/>These are calculated by subtracting the accrued interest from the total income. They represent the “net” deposit amount (the original principal) in both local currency and NZD.<br/><strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>Understanding the net value is key to determining the true underlying deposit after accounting for interest earnings.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-2.TransactionMeasuresforTermDeposits">2. Transaction Measures for Term Deposits</h3><ul><li><p><strong>TotalTDInterestPaid</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This measure sums up the actual interest payments made on term deposits—capturing the cash that has been paid out as interest.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>It shows the real cash flow from interest payments, which is useful for reconciling with bank statements.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalTDTaxPaid</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>It captures the tax amounts withheld or paid on those term deposit interest payments.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>Tax impacts the net income received. This measure is essential for understanding the full cost/benefit of term deposit earnings.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalTDInterestGross</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This is the sum of interest paid and the tax paid, giving the “gross” interest figure before tax is deducted.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>It provides a complete view of the earnings potential of the term deposits without the effect of tax deductions, useful for performance comparisons.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-3.CashManagementMeasures">3. Cash Management Measures</h3><ul><li><p><strong>TotalCMInterest, TotalCMTax, &amp; TotalCMGross</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong><br/>These measures capture the cash management side:</p><ul><li><p><strong>TotalCMInterest:</strong> Interest earned on daily cash management transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalCMTax:</strong> Tax applied on these cash management transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalCMGross:</strong> Their sum, representing the gross cash management earnings. <strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>They help assess the performance and tax impact of short‑term liquidity management—critical for managing everyday cash flows.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>TotalCMBalance</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This measure gives the balance of the cash management account as seen in the month‑end snapshot.<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>It indicates how much cash is available, which is key for day‑to‑day operations and liquidity analysis.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-4.CSL(SpecialCashHoldings)Measures">4. CSL (Special Cash Holdings) Measures</h3><ul><li><p><strong>TotalCSLIntTax, TotalCSLIntNet, &amp; TotalCSLIntGross</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>TotalCSLIntTax:</strong> Tax on interest for a special group of transactions (non-Cashman and not term deposits).</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalCSLIntNet:</strong> The net interest earned in these transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalCSLIntGross:</strong> The sum of net interest and its tax, providing the gross amount. <strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>They offer insight into a specific set of cash holdings managed under special arrangements, helping auditors and managers understand the performance of these niche investments.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>TotalCSLDivTax, TotalCSLDivNet, &amp; TotalCSLDivGross</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong><br/>These work like the interest measures but focus on dividend payments (money distributed from profits).<br/><strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>They help clarify how much dividend income is generated and how much tax is applied, which is essential for net income calculations.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-5.MPSHoldingsandSTARTSchemeMeasures">5. MPS Holdings and START Scheme Measures</h3><ul><li><p><strong>TotalHoldingMPS</strong><br/><strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>This measure sums up the holdings for investments identified by specific codes (like MPS, IAS, or DIMS).<br/><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>It provides a total value for these particular types of investments, offering a focused view on a segment of the portfolio.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalSTART, TotalHoldingSC, &amp; TotalHolding</strong><br/><strong>What They Mean:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>TotalSTART:</strong> Total value of the START scheme holdings (a separate investment managed by another company).</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalHoldingSC:</strong> The safe-keeping balance, which is money kept in a secure holding account.</p></li><li><p><strong>TotalHolding:</strong> The overall total, combining safe-keeping, MPS holdings, and START scheme holdings. <strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br/>These measures give a complete picture of the portfolio’s value by aggregating all different types of holdings. This overall total is critical for assessing the institution’s financial health and for making strategic decisions.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-BringingItAllTogether">Bringing It All Together</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Dynamic Parameters:</strong><br/>All these measures are built to use a specific reporting date (always a month‑end) and financial year. This consistency ensures that every calculation refers to the same point in time—making the report accurate and reliable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Filter Context:</strong><br/>Each measure applies filters to focus only on the relevant data (like term deposits, Cashman, or non-Cashman assets). This is like using a sieve to pick out only the pieces you need for each calculation, ensuring accuracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aggregation and Netting:</strong><br/>Many measures work by summing up amounts and then subtracting related values (such as subtracting accrued interest from total income to find the net face value). These arithmetic operations provide the “net” or “gross” figures necessary for understanding overall performance.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="Temp5-WhyThisMattersFinancially">Why This Matters Financially</h3><p>For auditors, managers, and analysts, these measures allow you to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Assess Value and Performance:</strong><br/>Understand how much money is held in different accounts and how much interest or dividend income has accrued.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluate Tax Impact:</strong><br/>See both the gross earnings and the impact of taxes on those earnings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure Consistency:</strong><br/>Since the model uses a month‑end snapshot, every measure is based on the same stable point in time, making comparisons across months reliable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Informed Decisions:</strong><br/>By combining data from multiple sources (snapshot, transactional, external), the model gives a comprehensive view of financial performance, aiding in decision‑making and strategy.</p></li></ul><p>This breakdown should help demystify the complex formulas and show you how each piece contributes to the overall financial report.</p>
